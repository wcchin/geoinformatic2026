### CPGIS

The Geoinformatics Conference series was initiated by the <u>International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS)</u> in 1992 and has held thirty-two annual international conferences on geographic informatics all over the world. This international conference series has provided a unique platform for networking and exchanging new ideas and cutting-edge knowledge among diverse GIScience professionals worldwide.



### Geoinformatics 2026

**Geoinformatics 2026** (the 33rd CPGIS Annual Conference), will be held from <u>July 19 to 22, 2026</u>, at the <u>National University of Singapore, Republic of Singapore</u>. The conference is dedicated to exploring the latest advancements and innovations in Geoinformatics, focusing on the theme "**Geo-Innovations for a Sustainable and Resilient Society**." Geoinformatics 2026 aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration by showcasing cutting-edge research and promoting knowledge exchange among researchers, practitioners, and industry experts. By addressing **sustainability and resilience** challenges, the conference seeks to drive innovation and transform our living environment. The event will feature keynote speeches from renowned experts, parallel sessions, poster presentations, and a student best paper competition. Participants will engage in discussions on emerging trends, share practical experiences, and explore opportunities for future collaboration.
