# This is a website for the 33rd CPGIS conference --- Geoinformatic 2026  

## Backend

This website is developed using [MkDocs 1.6.1](https://www.mkdocs.org/) static site generator. 

The python environment is `anaconda3-2022.10`, but this shouldnâ€™t be an issue. 



## Frontend

[Bulma css framework](https://bulma.io/) (1.0.4) is used as the frontend layout, grid, and text size etc. 

Google fonts are used for font style: 

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for H1 - H3 headings
- [Cal Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cal+Sans) for H4 - H6 headings
- [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) for body text

The main color scheme follows the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/) for both dark and light mode. 



## Host

Currently host on Github pages as a project (here): https://github.com/wcchin/geoinformatic2026

And deploy on Netlify (autodeploy from Github): https://geoinformatics-2026.netlify.app/
