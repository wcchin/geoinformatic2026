Call for papers Authors can choose to submit either an extended abstract or a full paper (but not both) through EasyChair ( url ). Authors of accepted extended abstract or full paper will be invited to give oral or poster presentations at the conference. Acceptance priority will be given to submissions with concrete research results. Potential publication outlets include the following: Conference proceedings by IEEE (pending for approval) Annal of GIS https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tagi20 Computational Urban Science https://link.springer.com/journal/43762 Information Geography https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-geography Authors of full papers can choose to publish their papers in the Conference Proceedings published by IEEE or special issues in peer-reviewed journals. Full paper submissions [description on format] link to template A full paper for the Conference Proceedings must follow the format requirements of IEEE. Please use the template of full paper for Conference Proceedings to prepare the submission. The length of such a full paper is 6-8 pages. It is highly recommended that the paper be proofread by an experienced English editor. Papers that do not meet the format and language requirements will not be further reviewed for content. Submissions link for full paper: Link For accepted full papers, authors can choose whether they wanted to publish their full papers in the Conference Proceedings (IEEE Conference Proceedings) or NOT with the conference proceedings, but instead submit them to special issues of international journals associated with the conference. If an author chooses to submit her/his paper to a journal, the paper must follow the format requirements of that particular journal and will go through the regular peer-review process of that journal. Associated journals include: Annal of GIS https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tagi20 Computational Urban Science https://link.springer.com/journal/43762 Information Geography https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-geography Important Notes : For a full paper to be included in the conference proceedings, the author(s) must present it in the Geoinformatics annual conference.
